                    "In most African countries, the traditional method a developer has used in the past in order to raise capital involved burdensome collateral requirements, unreasonably high interest rates, lack of access to interested investors, and proof of occupancy. Doing business this way has almost always brought true and high quality real estate development to a reluctant pace. Project crowd funding is a state-of-the-art solution of pitching one’s project to interested audiences around the world in order to raise funds.",
